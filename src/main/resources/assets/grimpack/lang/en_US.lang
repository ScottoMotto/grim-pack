grimpack.manual.info.subsection.intro=Introduction
grimpack.manual.info.subsection.intro.page.info=The GrimPack contains a large amount of blocks, items, entities, world gen, and more. The pack is a conglomeration of all of the mods I (Grim3212) updated in the past. The Pack itself has versions back to <a href="https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/grim-pack/files/2299844">1.8.9</a> while all of the separate mods that this is made of may data back to 1.1.0. As of right now there are currently 7 parts to the pack. Each focusing on a specific set of blocks, items, or something else. Things are still being changed and added to GrimPack whenever I have some spare time. The Pack is very configurable and you disable parts or subparts for pretty much everything except a few things from Grim Core.<br>This website pulls all of it's information from the Instruction Manual so it follows the same order as it would appears in the manual. So, with each update this site will be updated with the new info and always be up-to-date. Pulling from the manual also means that if a language is translated then the website will have support for that language.

grimpack.manual.info.subsection.intro.page.wip=Since the GrimPack is a combination of all of my old mods I am always trying to update some of the ones I haven't updated yet and add them into the pack. Depending on the mod it can be quite complex and take time where as some are very easy. I also have bugs to be fixed and requests come in. Sometimes they will interest me and I will try and add the ideas if they seem feasible.<br><br><strong class="text-danger">The pack is always changing!!</strong><br><br>I do not have time to work on this many separate mods so if I want to make something new it gets added as an option in the GrimPack. It takes time for things to happen so just be patient and see how the pack changes over time.

grimpack.manual.info.subsection.recipes.page.crafting.title=Crafting Recipes
grimpack.manual.info.subsection.recipes.page.crafting=Crafting recipes in GrimPack will come in two variants. Shaped or Shapeless and this depends on the type of recipe. So, if it requires a certain pattern then 'Crafting Shaped' will appear under. If it can be put in any order then 'Crafting Shapeless. will appear under.<br>Crafting recipes also can contain ore dictionary items. If an input for a recipe accepts an oreDict entry there will be a <font color="gold">GOLD</font> glow around it and if you hover over the item the oreName will appear at the bottom of the tooltip.
grimpack.manual.info.subsection.recipes.page.furnace.title=Furnace Recipes
grimpack.manual.info.subsection.recipes.page.furnace=Furnace recipes will only contain an input and output. Place the item specified in the left side and you will get the item on the right side.
grimpack.manual.info.subsection.recipes.page.other.title=Other Recipes
grimpack.manual.info.subsection.recipes.page.other=There are also a few other recipes that are available right now but these are only for <a href="/grim-pack/industry/machines">Machines</a>. These follow the same rules as the furnace for getting the output. But some can contain oreNames just like with Crafting Recipes so look for the <font color="gold">GOLD</font> glow around an input and hover over it to see the oreName.
grimpack.manual.info.subsection.configuration=Configuration
grimpack.manual.info.subsection.configuration.info=We will not look at all the ways to modify the GrimPack to your liking. There are many ways to get to the config.

grimpack.manual.info.subsection.resourcepacks.page.looks.title=Looks & Sounds
grimpack.manual.info.subsection.resourcepacks.page.looks=Once you are familiar with how ResourcePacks work you can get started on changing the way blocks and items look. All items and blocks use vanilla's model system, except for <a href="/grim-pack/decor/superslopes">SuperSlopes</a>.<br>Super Slopes use 3D obj models. You can use <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> to edit or create new models. Also most <a href="/grim-pack/decor/furniture">Colorizer</a> blocks don't explicitly set a texture since their texture is supposed to be dynamic. These models when designed should use 'tintindex' since they are supposed to be able to take on a blocks color as well.<br>There are a few sounds that are distributed with GrimPack. You should be able to change them as you would with any other sound. A list of sounds included can be found at <strong class="text-primary"><a href="https://github.com/grim3212/grim-pack/tree/master/src/main/resources/assets/grimpack/sounds">here</a></strong>

grimpack.manual.info.subsection.faq.page.about.title=About
grimpack.manual.info.subsection.faq.page.about=The GrimPack is a combination of older mods that I updated in the past. There were many mods that I maintained separately. I started to run out of time and updating was a huge pain for over 30 mods. So, I decided to combine them into one pack to make it easier for me.<br>I started playing Minecraft in Beta 1.2_02. I started modding towards the end of Beta but released my first public mod for 1.1.0. Ever since then I have enjoyed making mods and keeping others ideas alive. GrimPack contains many Beta mods that were abandoned as well as newer abandoned mods. I have been the core developer of the separate mods as well as GrimPack. But we have had a <a href="https://github.com/grim3212/grim-pack/graphs/contributors">few contributors</a>.
